This package is intended to serve as a resource for those currently under quarantine who lack chicken dip recipes. The recipe below is intended to serve those who suffer most from the lack of chicken dip recipes. As always, I am here to support those in need however I can.

## Required Equipment
* Slow cooker / Crockpot
* Open Mind

## Ingredients
* 1 - 1.5 lb. chicken breast (450-675 grams)
* 1 packet of taco seasoning (6 grams)
* 1 container of fresh salsa (You are an adult)
* 1 can black beans (780 grams)
* 1 can of corn (300 grams)
* 8 oz cream cheese (230 grams)
* 1 cup of cheddar cheese (245 grams)

You may note the container of fresh salsa has no associated units. The recipe passed down to me did not specify. For those who have had it from me, I typically get 24 oz cans. Choose the heat level to match your personal preferences. If you're not sure of a preferred heat level, mix and match. When I make this, I typically get one hot and one medium salsa to use in my double batch.

## Directions

First, a preface on slow cooker size. The slow cooker [I use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DZQTW?tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) _just_ fits a double batch and is rated at 5 quarts. A 4 quart slow cooker would most likely not handle a double batch. Plan your ingredients accordingly and remember that a double batch would last a family of four at least 2-3 days. Now, onto the actual directions...

1. In the slow cooker, layer chicken, taco seasoning, salsa, black beans (not drained), corn (drained)
2. Cook on high for two hours or low for 6 hours -- It is done when the chicken can be easily shredded using a fork
3. Once the chicken is cooked and easily shredded via fork, shred the chicken entirely by either removing it from the slow cooker or shredding in the slow cooker itself
4. Add cream cheese and cheddar cheese and stir until mixed

That's it. A few additional personal notes: I typically cut the cream cheese into a few blocks to increase surface area and reduce mixing time. I also typically use shredded sharp cheddar cheese from a bag (one bag is all that is required for a double batch). 

The primary vehicle for consuming chicken dip is a tortilla chip. I recommend getting heavily fortified chips (Mission Rounds) as chicken dip is a dense substance. If feeling creative, this can be mixed with rice or eaten with a fork alone -- chicken dip is _very_ versatile.
